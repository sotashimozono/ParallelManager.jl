**HPC experiment runtime for Julia** — multi-master safe, crash-recoverable,
`Pkg.test()`-fast. Wraps [ParamIO.jl](https://github.com/QAtlasHub/ParamIO.jl)
and [DataVault.jl](https://github.com/QAtlasHub/DataVault.jl) with a
unified `run!` that handles parallel dispatch, advisory locking, `.done`
rollups, structured event logging, and retry.

Designed to replace the recurring "glue" layer that every HPC research
project re-invents: the script that loops over parameter points, decides
which ones still need work, runs them on SLURM / Distributed / threads,
survives kills, and logs what happened.

## Highlights

- **Multi-master safe** — several `julia` processes can hit the same vault
  root without double-executing any key. Locking is delegated to
  `DataVault.acquire_running!`, which uses POSIX `link()` for an atomic
  "create iff not exists" that works on NFS — the `.running` marker is the lock.
- **Crash recovery** — `kill -9` a master mid-run and the next `run!` picks up
  where it left off: `DataVault` writes a heartbeat into `.running`, and
  `cleanup_stale` reclaims markers whose heartbeat has gone cold.
- **Early skip** — full-done re-runs take O(1) filesystem operations
  (a single `manifest.jld2` read), not O(N) per-key `.done` stats.
  Benchmark: 3600 keys warm re-run ≈ 3.5 ms.
- **Structured events** — JSONL event log atomic across concurrent writers;
  per-item `println` is a non-goal, by design.
- **One entry point for all parallel modes** — `init_workers!(mode=:auto)`
  dispatches to `:sequential` / `:threads` / `:distributed` / `:slurm`
  depending on environment.
- **Pure work functions** — your physics is a plain
  `(DataKey) -> Dict`, IO/locking/logging live in the runtime.

## Quick start

```julia
using ParamIO, DataVault, ParallelManager

# 1. Load the parameter sweep
spec  = ParamIO.load("config.toml")
keys  = ParamIO.expand(spec)
vault = DataVault.Vault("config.toml"; run="phase1")

# 2. Bootstrap workers (auto-detects SLURM / threads / sequential)
ParallelManager.init_workers!(mode=:auto)

# 3. Describe the work as a pure function
work_fn = key -> Dict{String,Any}("spectrum" => my_dmrg(key.params["N"]))

# 4. Run — manifest-aware, lock-safe, crash-recoverable
ParallelManager.run!(work_fn, vault, keys)
```

Re-running the same script after completion: `:skip_complete` is logged and
the process exits within milliseconds regardless of `length(keys)`.

## Phase chaining without `Stage` / `DAG`

A dependent stage loads its parent's output inside the work function using
one line of `DataVault.load`. There is **no** path-building helper, no
`Stage` abstraction, no `DAG` — just the regular work_fn pattern.

```julia
phase1_vault = DataVault.Vault(config_path; run="phase1")
phase2_vault = DataVault.Vault(config_path; run="phase2")

work_fn = key -> begin
    mps = DataVault.load(phase1_vault, key)   # ← the one line
    return Dict{String,Any}("energy" => measure_thermal(mps))
end

ParallelManager.run!(work_fn, phase2_vault, keys)
```

This is the canonical replacement for the `p2_phase1_mps_path`-style string
path builders that leak phase1's storage layout into phase2's code.

## Module layout

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`src/AtomicIO.jl`](src/AtomicIO.jl) | `atomic_write` / `atomic_touch` — tmp + fsync + POSIX rename, NFS-safe |
| [`src/EventLog.jl`](src/EventLog.jl) | JSONL structured log, single-write atomic lines for concurrent appends |
| [`src/Manifest.jl`](src/Manifest.jl) | Stage-level rollup of `canonical(key)` strings for O(1) early-skip |
| [`src/InitWorkers.jl`](src/InitWorkers.jl) | Unified `:auto` / `:sequential` / `:threads` / `:distributed` / `:slurm` bootstrap |
| [`src/Run.jl`](src/Run.jl) | `run!(work_fn, vault, keys; opts)` facade that ties everything to `DataVault` |

Each module is one file, one concern. They can be used independently
(e.g. `atomic_write` + `EventLog` without `run!`).

## Pain points it answers

Built from direct experience with the old-style HPC loop pattern used in
`FiniteTemperature.jl`:

| Pain | This package's answer |
| --- | --- |
| `.done` files rescanned every job (3600 files, ~10 min) | `Manifest` rollup, one JLD2 read (< 10 ms) |
| 300 MB of per-item `println` logs | `EventLog` (JSONL), per-item `println` is not part of the API |
| Killed samples silently wedge the queue | Heartbeat + `is_stale` + `reclaim!` auto-recover on next run |
| Multiple masters double-execute the same key | `DataVault.acquire_running!` (POSIX `link()`) + post-lock `is_done` re-check |
| Half-written JLD2 files after crash | `atomic_write` (tmp + fsync + rename) |
| Every project reinvents SLURM / Distributed bootstrap | `init_workers!(mode=:auto)` absorbs the pattern |

## Installation

```julia
pkg> add ParallelManager
```

Its dependencies `ParamIO.jl` and `DataVault.jl` are in the General registry too, so nothing
needs a `[sources]` entry.

Requires Julia v1.11+.

## Tests

`Pkg.test()` runs ~4200 tests in ~22 seconds, including:

- `atomicio/` — atomic write, exception cleanup, concurrent writers
- `eventlog/` — JSON roundtrip, 50-task × 40-event concurrent write
- `manifest/` — save/load, `todo_keys`, 3600-key bench, corrupted file
- `init_workers/` — `:auto`, `:sequential`, `:threads`, `:slurm` env reading
- `run/` — minimal, manifest early-skip, 4-master keylock race, retry, gave_up
