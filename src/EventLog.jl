# EventLog — structured JSONL event logging.
#
# Per-item `println` logging is a non-goal and is not part of the public API.
# FiniteTemperature.jl used to emit ~300 MB of job logs by printing a line
# for every one of 3600 keys; switching to aggregated events collapses that
# to ~1 event per key plus a handful of per-stage events.

    EventLog(path::AbstractString)

Append-only JSONL event log with a thread-safe per-`EventLog` lock.

Each call to [`log_event`](@ref) writes one JSON object as a single line.
Concurrent writes from multiple tasks (within one master) are serialized
through an internal `ReentrantLock`. Concurrent writes from multiple
_processes_ (separate masters) rely on POSIX `O_APPEND` atomicity, which
is guaranteed for single `write` syscalls of length `< PIPE_BUF` (4 KiB);
`log_event` composes each line as a single `String` and issues exactly
one `write(io, line)` call to stay within that guarantee.

# Fields

- `path::String` — target JSONL file. Parent directory is created lazily on
  first [`log_event`](@ref).
- `lock::ReentrantLock` — protects appends from same-process races.

# Event kinds used by `run!`

[`run!`](@ref) emits the following `kind` values (as strings in the JSON):

| kind            | when                                                              |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `stage_start`   | once at the top of `run!` when `todo` is non-empty                |
| `stage_done`    | once at the bottom of `run!` when `todo` was non-empty            |
| `key_start`     | before each `work_fn(key)` attempt (includes `attempt` field)     |
| `key_done`      | after a successful `work_fn(key)` (includes `secs`, `attempt`)    |
| `lock_busy`     | `KeyLock.try_acquire` returned `false`                            |
| `lock_reclaimed`| (reserved, not currently emitted)                                 |
| `error`         | `work_fn` threw on this attempt                                   |
| `retry`         | another attempt will follow                                       |
| `gave_up`       | all `max_attempts` attempts exhausted                             |
| `skip_complete` | full-done early exit (manifest had every key)                     |

Downstream analysis (`jq`, DataFrame-based) can filter and aggregate over
these kinds without ever parsing freeform text.

# Example

```julia
log = EventLog("out/events.jsonl")
log_event(log, :stage_start; stage=:phase1, todo=3600)
# ... work ...
log_event(log, :stage_done; stage=:phase1, done=3600, err=0)
```

EventLog(path::AbstractString) = EventLog(String(path), ReentrantLock())

"""
    log_event(log, kind; kwargs...)

Append one JSON object to `log.path` with fields `ts` (ISO-8601 local time),
`kind` (the `Symbol` converted to `String`), and any additional key/value
pairs passed via `kwargs`.

The line is built in full (including the trailing newline) as a single
`String`, then written with exactly one `write(io, line)` call inside an
`open(path, "a")` block. This relies on POSIX `O_APPEND` atomicity so that
cross-process writes do not tear each other's lines.

```julia
log_event(log, :key_done; stage=:phase1, key="N=8;J=1.0;#sample=1", secs=12.3)
```

produces one line like:

```json
{"ts":"2026-04-13T14:23:51.123","kind":"key_done","stage":"phase1","key":"N=8;J=1.0;#sample=1","secs":12.3}
```

Returns `nothing`.
