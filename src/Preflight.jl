# Preflight — answer "can this campaign run" before spending the compute.
#
# Ported out of FiniteTemperature.jl, where it was written after the same class
# of defect had cost a campaign four separate times. The shape is always the
# same: **declared in one place, relied on in another, checked nowhere.**
#
#   [datavault] float_format = "auto"   the config asked; the path builder ignored it
#   beta_quench ⊆ beta_targets          required in a comment
#   the downstream stage knowing the    required in a comment
#     upstream discretisation
#   the checkpoint directory carrying   not carried at all
#     the parameter that distinguishes runs
#
# Each is decidable by comparing strings before any physics runs. What lives
# here is the part that is not specific to any one study:
#
#   * the report — `Finding`, `PreflightReport`, `launchable`, and a `show` that
#     groups by layer so a refusal names its own cause
#   * `check_injective!` — distinct parameter points must get distinct paths.
#     This is THE check: a collision means one point silently overwrites another
#     AND its `.done` marker completes work that never ran.
#   * `check_opens!` — opening a vault can itself fail (a shared `project_name`
#     with differing `path_keys` is a startup crash, not a warning), and that
#     belongs in the report rather than as a stack trace out of the checker
#   * `on_grid` / `representative_keys` — the two predicates every study repeats
#
# A study adds its own layers on top: which values must lie on which grid, and
# whether the artefact a later stage LOOKS for is the one an earlier stage
# WRITES. That last one is the decisive check and it cannot be generic, because
# only the study knows what its stages hand each other — but it is always built
# the same way: generate the path from BOTH sides and compare the strings,
# rather than trusting a comment that says they agree.

    Finding(layer, severity, where, message)

One reason a campaign cannot (or should not) start.

`layer` is the study's own vocabulary — `:config`, `:grid`, `:injective`,
`:crossphase` in the original — and exists so that a refusal is attributable.
Layering that cannot distinguish two different causes is decoration; a study's
tests should assert that a deliberately broken config is rejected by the RIGHT
layer, not merely rejected.

True when nothing at `:error` severity was found. Warnings do not block.

downstream stage, long after the compute is spent.

One key per distinct parameter point.

would therefore report `n_samples` false collisions for every real one.

    check_injective!(findings, layer, label, name, paths)

Assert that `paths` has no duplicates, i.e. that distinct parameter points map
to distinct files.

This is the check worth having. Under a content-blind float rendering (`%.2f`),
`h = 0.002` and `0.004` both render `h0.00`, so two points share a directory —
and not only their observables. They share the **status marker**, which means
the second point is reported complete without ever running. A sweep of 168
points then finishes as 132 with no error anywhere.

Pass the status paths as well as the data paths. Checking only the data half
catches the overwrite and misses the skipped work, which is the worse of the two.

Run `open_fn()` and, if it throws, record the failure instead of propagating it.

`log.toml conflict` when two stages of one campaign share a `project_name` but
declare different `path_keys`. A driver that opens several vaults in a row dies
at startup on that, so it belongs in the report next to everything else rather
than as a stack trace out of the checker.
